React Framework
Material UI used as UI tool

## POC 

User should not be able to add Different Video Standard & Definition in One Show Reel.

So, to optimize the process , Video Defintions & Video Standrds will be show in DDL frst .

Based on both selection, video Clips will be fetched accordingly in Data Grid.

DataGrid will have a selection checkbox , through which we can add and remove video clips.

parallely , the Time will be calculated in TimeReelAPi based on addition and removal of Video Clips.

A TextBox -> to add name will be added and availability check can also be added to check if the name is present or not.

 Then Click on Add butoon , Show reel will be created .
 
 
 
 User Selects Video definition & Standard -> VideoClips Fetched -> User Can selected and unselect from Data Grid -> parallel the Time Duration calculated 
 -> Add Name -> Click Name Check Availability -> If Yes,User `clicks Add Show Reel -> If No User, again try to give Unique Name.
 
 Please note that we can provide the feature to edit the start time in video clips , so that user can take some part of existing of existing clip, and time 
 duration will be calculated and show reel will be saved Accordingly.
 
 ## Development
 
 Not able to complete UI fully, Completed till getting videoClips.But i can complete , getting little bit more time.
